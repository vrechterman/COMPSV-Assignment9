design memo

For this assignment I was tasked to model a social network by using a graph data structure, 
using the graphs I was able to represent the relationships between the people. With that 
being said this system was able to connect, manage, and display the entire network of 
peopleâ€™s relationships. In the network each person was under a node and or a vertex. 
Then the connection between two nodes is each friendship, which is under an edge, also 
known as a connection. So, for this assignment it is most ideal to use a graph so you 
can represent the social network, because of how naturally it is able to connect one to 
another with friendships. And bidirectional is used so that each friend can have 
many friends, and not just one. For this assignment I also used the adjacency list 
approach because it stores each person as a key, with a list of all the relationships. 
This allows for the system to be faster and more scalable. The main goals for this assignment 
and what I learned was; how to implement a person class, implement a socialnetwork, create
 methods to add a person to the network, bidirectional friendship, print the network. 
 As well as, applying graph theory to real world systems, building object-oriented relationships.
